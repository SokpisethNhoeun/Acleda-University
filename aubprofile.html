Dr. HANGCHUON NARON, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport.</p></a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para">ACLEDA University of Business (AUB) ― recognized by Samdech Moha Borvor Thipadei HUN MANET, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia through Sub-Decree No. 27 RNK. BK dated February 12, 2024 (formerly known as the ACLEDA Institute of Business, AIB) ― stands as a testament to the nation's unwavering commitment to fostering a skilled workforce and propelling economic growth. Its rich history, spanning over three decades, intertwines with the remarkable rise of ACLEDA Bank Plc., Cambodia's leading financial institution. This narrative delves into AUB's evolution, highlighting its unwavering commitment to empowering individuals and organizations through knowledge and skills development.
        </p>
        <p class="para">The story of AUB began in 1993, amidst the nascent stages of ACLEDA's journey. In this early period, a dedicated technical support team operated within ACLEDA NGO, laying the groundwork for what would become a prominent educational institution. As ACLEDA MFI emerged in 1997, the need for specialized training grew. This led to the establishment of the Training &amp; Consultancy Service Division, followed by the creation of the Training Center in January 1998. With a clear vision for empowering its workforce, ACLEDA recognized the critical role of education in achieving success.</p>
        <p class="para">
            The new millennium ushered in a period of continuous development for the training unit. As ACLEDA evolved into a Specialized Bank in January 2001, the training unit adapted accordingly. Subsequent years witnessed further refinement – the unit transitioned into the Training Department in 2006 within ACLEDA Bank Plc. By September 2008, it had established itself as the Training Center, solidifying its position as a crucial pillar within the bank's structure. This dedication to internal training ensured ACLEDA's staff would possess the necessary skills and knowledge to navigate the increasingly complex financial landscape.
        </p>
        <p class="para">The year 2009 marked a significant milestone with the formation of the Training Division within ACLEDA Bank Plc. This expansion reflected a growing need for comprehensive training programs. Recognizing the potential for regional collaboration, ACLEDA broadened its vision by establishing the ACLEDA-ASEAN Regional Microfinance Training Center in June 2010. This initiative, generously supported by the Royal Government of Cambodia and co-financed by the Federal Republic of Germany through KfW, aimed to empower microfinance institutions (MFIs) across the ASEAN region and beyond.</p>
        <p class="para">August 2011 stood as a pivotal moment – witnessing the birth of the ACLEDA Training Center (ATC) as a legal entity. This formalization marked the culmination of years of dedication to staff training and a growing aspiration to serve a wider audience. The ATC was established under the regulations governing Commercial Rules and Register Law, Commercial Enterprises Law, Civil Code, and Penal Code of the Kingdom of Cambodia. It signified a strategic merger between ACLEDA Bank Plc.'s Training Division and the ACLEDA-ASEAN Regional Microfinance Training Center. This union symbolized the convergence of internal expertise and regional collaboration, creating a robust platform for knowledge dissemination. Importantly, the Ministry of Commerce of the Kingdom of Cambodia officially recognized ATC as a Single Member Private Limited Company on September 13, 2011. This recognition empowered ATC to offer its training programs not only to ACLEDA staff but also to external participants from local and international organizations as well as the public.</p>

        </ul>
        <p class="para">The year 2016 witnessed another momentous occasion – the transformation of ATC into ACLEDA Institute of Business (AIB) through Sub-Decree No. 13 RNK. BK dated 25 January 2016. This elevation to university status underscored AIB's dedication to providing high-quality tertiary education. AIB offered Associate's Degrees, Bachelor's Degrees, and Master's Degrees, catering to a broader spectrum of students seeking business-related qualifications. This expansion signifies AUB's commitment to nurturing future business leaders and contributing to Cambodia's economic prosperity.</p>
        <p class="para">From its humble beginnings as a technical support team to its present-day stature as a university, AUB's journey reflects an unwavering commitment to education. Over the decades, AUB has empowered countless individuals, not only within ACLEDA Bank but also across Cambodia and the region. Its legacy lies in fostering a skilled workforce, promoting financial inclusion, and driving sustainable economic growth. As AUB enters its next chapter, it stands poised to continue its mission of shaping well-rounded professionals and contributing to a brighter future for Cambodia.</p>
